 #EPOCA: The Tree of Ecof is the inspiring tale of two talented and diverse young track and field athletes who must ‘race’ to find their inner magic and #grana in order to save their classmates (and each other) from evil forces.
 This novel holds a special place of importance for me because it was the first @Granity story I started crafting while still playing in the NBA. The audiobook is read by Phylicia Rashad, who has been an inspiration to me since I was a kid. pic.twitter.com/0YEHCEh7NV

 Doing a dance to miss the game isn’t a bad thing. That’s not what I was saying. I was just giving context as to why she wasn’t in the picture. All my girls play/played diff sports. It’s all good and For the record I followed their lead on not smiling. They HATED those trophies
 sorry if it came across as a slight, trust me it wasn’t. I was just giving the reason for her not being in the pic. They chose not to smile for the pic I actually followed their lead. Our team has become family and this includes the 7th player
 🤷🏽‍♂️ some kids hate loosing bro and that’s ok. They have worked hard to improve because of it.
 Nah fam I was just explaining why she wasn’t in the pic. Most of my kids on the team played and still play other sports including my daughter so it’s all love. Don’t misunderstand the message.

 We all want our kids to be the best version of themselves and dream as big as they can to reach their highest potential. But chasing a dream takes a lot of courage. That’s what I want kids to learn by reading our novels.
 Legacy and the Queen will teach kids lessons in perseverance, commitment, hard work, compassion, and empathy. And the lessons built within the story are the same disciplines and prinples that I try to instill in my daughters everyday.
 So excited for this project and for you all to experience the magical journey of #LegacyandtheQueen. As kids get older, we hope they’ll start to understand the meanings and messages found in reading. And sports stories can serve as the greatest metaphors for life. pic.twitter.com/QRZBlykasz

 Welcome to the @LA_Sparks @mmabrey1 #WNBADraft2019
 Three years ago was my last week in a Lakers uniform. But the #MambaMentality continues to live on... As a husband, father, coach, producer, writer, and now in the newest limited-edition ball in the @Spalding 94 Series. Coming 4/12.  http://Spalding.com  pic.twitter.com/JrK5fSvJ1h
 WHAT A GAME! Congrats @BaylorWBB
 The @ndwbb team can struggle shooting for 36 minutes but seem to make every big shot to keep them in game and win it late which is what champs do. I can’t wait to see how they handle @BaylorWBB size This final is gonna be a great one #warinthepaint #wfinalfour

 Media critique- Mj was a gunner Magic was a coach killer Shaq wasn't serious Lbj couldn't handle pressure Spurs r too old #BeforeRings

 @_DevinBanks yea
 I can't be on the bench because I cannot travel yet #surgery
 To tweet or not to tweet.. I CHOOSE not 2. Focus should be on the team not my insight. @georgelopez voice "Can't DO nothin!"  #vinospeare
 @Dr_EZwider @A2daO Really?? U can't be that slow bra
 @kobebryant__  change ur @name. Ur avi and be funny without being disrespectful and I will gladly follow you.
 @James_Worthy42 @twcsportsnet @krambis Thx Big Game! I will be in the locker room with my guys thou
 @ILYKB24 yes.
 @lionelcoleman21 how could it? I'm sitting at home #thatsaillytalk. But I want the team focused on gm2, not this silly ish
 @Reckless831 thx bro but my dudes don't need the distraction   Period.
 @LAKERFANKEVIN88 I would but don't want my dudes having distractions plus some writers luv creating controversy so why give them the amo
 I see my tweeting during the game is being talked about as much as the game itself. Not my intention , just bored as I guess #notagain
 On to game 2. I will be watching from the crib again in a pau jersey and laker face paint ha! All jk aside We will be fine on wed #fanmamba
 @CountOnVic it was #nervesspeaking
 @CountOnVic @arashmarkazi if he kept his phone on so I could call him, I wouldn't have to tweet it LOL #imjoking #keepfocus #ontothenextone
 @AyyBeRaw ha! #nervousresponse I'm sure he didn't meant it that way #nobigdeal
 @DT_flash because I can't travel yet. Elevation from flight would cause swelling unfortunately.
 A fan?? Lol #microphonetalk
 @RealSkipBayless manu def had an impact on the games momentum. In gm 2 we gotta cut their penetration and post the ball more
 @PhilJackson11 will make sure the fellas r in line with that
 @PhilJackson11 I gotta do something. It's horrible not being able to at least be there with them.
 @RoCountsOnKobe 100%that's the key. Making adjustments. Chess not checkers
 Nothing worse then watching your bothers struggle and u can't do crap about it #realtalk
 Matador Defense on Parker. His penetration is hurting us
 @JoshuaBass91 get on block and make the game easier for ur guys Defensive transition on the bigs so we don't give up 3's to their guards
 @TaylorAshton17 yess sirr!!
 Gotta milk pau in the post right now and d12. Will get good looks from it
 @LakeShOwQueen he's the best power forward to play and my all time favorite to compete against #realtalk
 This game has a "steal one" written all over it for us
 @KatenSingler yea me 2!! Lol No telling what I might say! #rulechangescoming
 @LakerGangOrDie_ lot of correctable things. Lil strategic adjustments we can make Spurs hurt us with quiet 5-0/6-0 runs that kept us at bay
 @AlexLeeSays I can't travel yet. Altitude pressure causes swelling. Have to keep it elevated as much as possible
 @nbarocksstc I agree. Lethargic start for us. Gotta minimize little mistakes like giving up the middle drive on close outs
 Post. Post. Post.
 What I would say if I was there right now? "Pau get ur ass on the block and don't move till u get it" #realtalk
 @TheMontelShow spurs ability to change sides of the floor andget penetration is hurting us.have to pick up pressure,make them uncomfortable
 #redmamba haha I luv that
 @bkbb24 rhythm of the game. When it doesn't flow inside because of what the d allows we have to force the issue
 Gotta keep the spurs offense in front of our d. They r great at penetrating and pitching to their shooters
 Gotta get to the block. See wat spurs r gonna do with pau and d12
 I like how Nash is moving so far. Both teams a lil out of rhythm to start
 Thank you @nike for this surprise spread in the paper this am. It touched me beyond words. #showuIwill  http://instagram.com/p/YX3oQxxNr8/
